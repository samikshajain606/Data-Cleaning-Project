# Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning a real-world Airbnb dataset to improve data quality, consistency, and reliability. Data cleaning is an essential step in data analysis as it ensures accurate insights and better decision-making.

## Dataset
- AB_NYC_2019.csv

The dataset contains Airbnb listings in New York City, including information such as host details, room types, prices, locations, and availability.

## Objectives
- Identify and handle missing values
- Remove duplicate records
- Standardize data formats
- Detect and handle outliers
- Prepare a clean dataset for further analysis

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Explored the structure and data types.
3. Checked and handled missing values.
4. Removed duplicate records.
5. Standardized categorical values.
6. Detected and handled outliers in price.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Results
The dataset was successfully cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing outliers. The cleaned data is now more reliable for analysis and modeling.

## Conclusion
Data cleaning improves the quality and usability of datasets. This project demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques that are required before performing analysis or building machine learning models.
